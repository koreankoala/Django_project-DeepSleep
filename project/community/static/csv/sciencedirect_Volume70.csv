The association of obstructive sleep apnea with blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer’s dementia - A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and is characterized by the aggregation of extracellular amyloid-beta and intracellular hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is associated with increased AD risk. We hypothesize that OSA is associated with higher levels of AD biomarkers. The study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between OSA and levels of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD. Two authors independently searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies comparing blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels of dementia biomarkers between patients with OSA and healthy controls. Meta-analyses of the standardized mean difference were conducted using random-effects models. From 18 studies with 2804 patients, meta-analysis found that cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta-40 (SMD:-1.13, 95%CI:-1.65 to -0.60), blood total amyloid beta (SMD:0.68, 95%CI: 0.40 to 0.96), blood amyloid beta-40 (SMD:0.60, 95%CI: 0.35 to 0.85), blood amyloid beta-42 (SMD:0.80, 95%CI: 0.38 to 1.23) and blood total-tau (SMD: 0.664, 95% CI: 0.257 to 1.072, I2 = 82, p<0.01, 7 studies) were significantly higher in OSA patients compared with healthy controls. These findings suggest that OSA is associated with an elevation of some biomarkers of AD."
"A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between young adults’ sleep habits and substance use, with a focus on self-medication behaviours","Young adults (18–30 years) are vulnerable to sleep-wake disturbances and substance use, which are bi-directionally associated. The present work aims to organise the literature that deals with the association between sleep and substance use in young adults, also considering self-medication behaviours."
The interplay between symptoms of insomnia and pain in people with osteoarthritis: A narrative review of the current evidence,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and clinical pain is the major symptom of OA. This clinical OA-related pain is firmly associated with symptoms of insomnia, which are reported in up to 81% of people with OA. Since understanding the association between both symptoms is critical for their appropriate management, this narrative review synthesizes the existing evidence in people with OA on i) the mechanisms underlying the association between insomnia symptoms and clinical OA-related pain, and ii) the effectiveness of conservative non-pharmacological treatments on insomnia symptoms and clinical OA-related pain. The evidence available identifies depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy as mechanisms partially explaining the cross-sectional association between insomnia symptoms and pain in people with OA. Furthermore, in comparison to treatments without a specific insomnia intervention, the ones including an insomnia intervention appear more effective for improving insomnia symptoms, but not for reducing clinical OA-related pain. However, at a within-person level, treatment-related positive effects on insomnia symptoms are associated with a long-term pain reduction. Future longitudinal prospective studies offering fundamental insights into neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms explaining the association between insomnia symptoms and clinical OA-related pain will enable the development of effective treatments targeting both symptoms."
Associations between parental relationship dissolution and child sleep: A systematic review,"Parental relationship dissolution is considered one of the most common adverse childhood experiences. Although sleep is crucial for healthy development of children and very sensitive to environmental changes, it is poorly studied in the context of parental relationship dissolution. The aim of the current study was to systematically review and critically assess the existing literature on the associations between parental relationship dissolution and child sleep (0–18 years old; registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021272720)). PsycInfo, MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Social Work abstracts, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched. Published empirical quantitative studies were included if they reported statistics regarding the association between parental relationship dissolution and any child sleep variable. Out of the 358 articles screened, 14 articles met inclusion criteria and reported on several sleep dimensions: sleep quality, dreams and nightmares, and sleep disorders (enuresis, night terrors, and bruxism). Out of the 14 articles, six were longitudinal studies and eight were cross-sectional studies. While most studies found that parental relationship dissolution was associated with some indices of poorer child sleep, studies were generally of low to moderate quality. Health professionals should assess child sleep in the context of a parental relationship dissolution."
Is exposure to chemical pollutants associated with sleep outcomes? A systematic review,"Environmental exposures may influence sleep; however, the contributions of environmental chemical pollutants to sleep health have not been systematically investigated. We conducted a systematic review to identify, evaluate, summarize, and synthesize the existing evidence between chemical pollutants (air pollution, exposures related to the Gulf War and other conflicts, endocrine disruptors, metals, pesticides, solvents) and dimensions of sleep health (architecture, duration, quality, timing) and disorders (sleeping pill use, insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing)). Of the 204 included studies, results were mixed; however, the synthesized evidence suggested associations between particulate matter, exposures related to the Gulf War, dioxin and dioxin-like compounds, and pesticide exposure with worse sleep quality; exposures related to the Gulf War, aluminum, and mercury with insomnia and impaired sleep maintenance; and associations between tobacco smoke exposure with insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing, particularly in pediatric populations. Possible mechanisms relate to cholinergic signaling, neurotransmission, and inflammation. Chemical pollutants are likely key determinants of sleep health and disorders. Future studies should aim to evaluate environmental exposures on sleep across the lifespan, with a particular focus on developmental windows and biological mechanisms, as well as in historically marginalized or excluded populations."
Interventions to increase sleep duration in young people: A systematic review,"This systematic review explored the outcomes of current interventions to increase sleep duration in healthy young people (14–25 years). Nine databases were systematically searched, and 26 studies were included in this review. Quality assessment of the included studies was evaluated using two tools: the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and Cochrane Risk of Bias. The interventions incorporated a range of strategies including behavioral (46.2%), educational (26.9%), a combination of behavioral and educational (15.4%), and other strategies such as physical therapy (11.5%). The findings indicate that behavioral and combination interventions were consistently effective in increasing sleep duration in healthy young people. Educational interventions alone were less effective at increasing young people's sleep duration. Of all the included studies, only one randomized control trial but none of the non-randomized trials were rated as good quality. Our findings suggest a combination of strategies with an emphasis on personalization of intervention could possibly maximize the chances of success at improving sleep duration in healthy young people. More high-quality studies with long-term assessments (≥ 6 months) should be conducted to test the efficacy and durability of interventions to increase sleep duration in young people, as well as the clinical implications to mental and physical health."
Non-pharmacological and melatonin interventions for pediatric sleep initiation and maintenance problems: A systematic review and network meta-analysis,"Sleep initiation and maintenance problems are common in the pediatric population and while behavioral interventions are recommended, their efficacy remains to be evaluated in clinical trials. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatments and melatonin for sleep initiation and maintenance problems in healthy pediatric populations. We included 30 studies in the systematic review and 15 in the meta-analysis. Three network meta-analyses were conducted for sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST). For SOL variable, the results support greater effectiveness of light therapy and melatonin than evidence-based psychological interventions, whether implemented in combination with light therapy or not. Regarding WASO variable, evidence-based psychological interventions and a combination of those techniques plus light treatment were the most efficacious. Finally, for TST variable, a larger effect was shown for the combined treatment of evidence-based psychological intervention with light therapy in comparison to other interventions. In conclusion, we found a high variability between study protocols likely impacting the results of the meta-analysis. Future randomized control trials studies, stratified by pediatric age classes, are needed in order to provide clear suggestions in clinical settings."
Pharmacotherapy for obstructive sleep apnea - A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,Continuous positive airway pressure is the first-line and gold-standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Pharmacotherapy is not commonly used in treating OSA until recently. Combined noradrenergic and antimuscarinic agents have been clinically applied for OSA patients with variable results. This meta-analysis study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the combined regimen on OSA.
Melatonin use in children and adolescents: A scoping review of caregiver perspectives,"Despite melatonin's popularity as a pediatric sleep-aid, little has been investigated around caregivers' understanding and perception of melatonin use for their dependent. This scoping review analyzes the current literature on pediatric melatonin use, to understand how caregivers' perceptions around melatonin are shaped by their illness/medication-related beliefs, treatment experience and preferences. A literature search was conducted across Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus, generating 184 results for screening against the inclusion criteria. Nineteen studies were retrieved, comprising of 1561 children and adolescents, aged 8.7 ± 2.3 years (range: 0–44 years), conducted primarily in the United States of America (n = 6), Canada (n = 3) and the Netherlands (n = 3). Studies were evaluated for their study design and caregiver-centered outcomes, encompassing: 1) illness/treatment-related beliefs, 2) treatment satisfaction/effectiveness, 3) treatment preference/acceptability, and 4) impact of child's sleep disturbance on caregivers' quality-of-life. Sleep disturbances necessitating melatonin use occurred alongside congenital/neurodevelopmental comorbidities in 18 studies (95%). Melatonin was commonly associated with “naturalness” and “safety”. Concepts of treatment satisfaction versus effectiveness were minimally differentiated within included studies. Caregivers preferred concurrent use of melatonin and behavioral interventions for management of their dependents' sleep. Improved sleep in the dependent generally led to better quality-of-life for caregivers and their family."
Effect of phrenic nerve stimulation on patients with central sleep apnea: A meta-analysis,"Patients with central sleep apnea (CSA) have a lower quality of life and higher morbidity and mortality. Phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) is a novel treatment for CSA that has been shown to be safe. However, the effects of PNS on sleep changes are still under debate. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of PNS in patients with CSA. PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant studies published. We performed random-effects meta-analyses of the changes in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), central apnea index (CAI), Arousal Index, percent of sleep with O2 saturation <90% (T90), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and sleep efficiency. Ten studies with a total of 580 subjects were analyzed. Overall meta-analysis showed AHI [SMD: -2.24, 95% confidence interval (CI): was −3.11 to −1.36(p＜0.00001)], CAI [SMD: -2.32, 95% CI: -3.17 to −1.47 (p＜0.00001)] and Arousal Index (p = 0.0002, SMD (95% CI) −1.79 (−2.74 to −0.85)) significantly reduced after PNS. No significant changes were observed in T90, ESS and sleep efficiency (p > 0.05). Meta-analysis of observational studies demonstrated AHI, CAI and Arousal Index had a decreasing trend between before and after PNS (all, p＜0.05). However, ESS and T90 did not change significantly after PNS (p > 0.05). Meta-analysis of RCTs showed that CSA patients had trends of a lower AHI (I2 = 0%), CAI (I2 = 74%), Arousal Index (I2 = 0%), T90 (I2 = 0%) and ESS (I2 = 0%) after PNS (all, p＜0.05). The use of PNS appears to be safe and feasible in patients with CSA. However, larger, independent RCTs are required to investigate the efficacy and long-term effect of PNS and more attention should be paid to T90 and ESS."
