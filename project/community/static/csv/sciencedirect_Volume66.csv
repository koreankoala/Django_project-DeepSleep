Associations between sleep variability and cardiometabolic health: ,"A systematic review This review explored the associations between sleep variability and cardiometabolic health. It was performed following PRISMA guidelines. We identified 63 studies. Forty-one studies examined the association between sleep variability and body... composition, with 29 examined body mass index (BMI). Thirteen studies used social jet lag (SJL), n = 30,519, with nine reporting a null association. Eight studies used variability in sleep duration (n = 33,029), with five reporting a correlation with BMI. Fourteen studies (n = 133,403) focused on overweight/obesity; significant associations with sleep variability were found in 11 (n = 120,168). Sleep variability was associated with weight gain (seven studies; n = 79,522). Twenty-three studies examined glucose outcomes. The association with hemoglobin A1c (16 studies, n = 11,755) differed depending on populations, while associations with diabetes or glucose were mixed, and none were seen with insulin resistance (five studies; n = 6416). Sixteen studies examined cardiovascular-related outcomes, with inconsistent results. Overall significant associations were found in five studies focusing on metabolic syndrome (n = 7413). In summary, sleep variability was likely associated with obesity, weight gain, and metabolic syndrome. It might be associated with hemoglobin A1c in people with type 1 diabetes. The associations with other outcomes were mixed. This review highlighted the possible association between sleep variability and cardiometabolic health."
Research progress on the role of exosomes in obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome-related atherosclerosis,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Atherosclerosis, a multifactorial disease with complicated pathogenesis, is the main cause of CVD, underlying several major adverse cardiovascular events. Obesity is the main cause of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and a significant risk for atherosclerosis. OSA is an independent risk factor for CVD. Recent research has focused on understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms by which OSA influences atherosclerosis pathogenesis. The role of exosomes in this process has attracted considerable attention. Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicles (EV) that are released from many cells (both healthy and diseased) and mediate cell-to-cell communication by transporting microRNAs (miRNAs), proteins, mRNAs, DNA, or lipids to target cells, thereby modulating the functions of target cells and tissues. Intermittent hypoxia in OSA alters the exosomal carrier in circulation and promotes the permeability and dysfunction of endothelial cells, which have been associated with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This review discusses the potential roles of exosomes and exosome-derived molecules in the development and progression of OSA-related atherosclerosis. Additionally, we explore the possible mechanisms underlying OSA-related atherosclerosis and provide new insights for the development of novel exosome-based therapeutics for OSA-related atherosclerosis and CVD."
Efficacy of melatonin for chronic insomnia: ,"Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy of melatonin versus placebo or other hypnotic agents in improving sleep quality and quantity in patients with chronic insomnia. A literature search on Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed up to November 2020. Sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep quality and quality of life were examined as outcomes. We identified 24 randomized controlled trials of chronic insomnia including four studies of patients with comorbid insomnia. All studies were compared with placebo. Due to heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses by age group. In non-comorbid insomnia, melatonin was only significantly effective in sleep onset latency and total sleep time in children and adolescents. In adults group, melatonin was not significantly effective in improving sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency. In comorbid insomnia, melatonin significantly improved sleep onset latency in all age groups, but there was only one study in adults group. In conclusion, melatonin did not appear to be effective in adults but might be effective in children and adolescents with chronic insomnia for both comorbid insomnia and non-comorbid insomnia. Further studies are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of melatonin by age groups."
"Sleep, circadian biology and skeletal muscle interactions: Implications for metabolic health","There currently exists a modern epidemic of sleep loss, triggered by the changing demands of our 21st century lifestyle that embrace ‘round-the-clock’ remote working hours, access to energy-dense food, prolonged periods of inactivity, and on-line social activities. Disturbances to sleep patterns... impart widespread and adverse effects on numerous cells, tissues, and organs. Insufficient sleep causes circadian misalignment in humans, including perturbed peripheral clocks, leading to disrupted skeletal muscle and liver metabolism, and whole-body energy homeostasis. Fragmented or insufficient sleep also perturbs the hormonal milieu, shifting it towards a catabolic state, resulting in reduced rates of skeletal muscle protein synthesis. The interaction between disrupted sleep and skeletal muscle metabolic health is complex, with the mechanisms underpinning sleep-related disturbances on this tissue often multifaceted. Strategies to promote sufficient sleep duration combined with the appropriate timing of meals and physical activity to maintain circadian rhythmicity are important to mitigate the adverse effects of inadequate sleep on whole-body and skeletal muscle metabolic health. This review summarises the complex relationship between sleep, circadian biology, and skeletal muscle, and discusses the effectiveness of several strategies to mitigate the negative effects of disturbed sleep or circadian rhythms on skeletal muscle health."
Go to bed! A systematic review and meta-analysis of bedtime procrastination correlates and sleep outcomes,"Bedtime procrastination is defined as the volitional delay of going to bed, without any external circumstances causing the delay, and is associated with inadequate sleep. Alleviating bed time procrastination is an important target for interventions promoting adequate sleep, yet the correlates of bedtime procrastination are poorly understood. This study examined (1) correlates of bedtime procrastination, and (2) strength and direction of the association between bedtime procrastination and sleep outcomes. Six databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched from inception to September 2021 against pre-determined eligibility criteria. Forty-three studies were included (GRADE = low). Meta-analysis revealed that bedtime procrastination had a moderate negative association with self-control (z = −0.39; CI: −0.45, −0.29) and a moderate positive association with evening chronotype (z = 0.43; CI: 0.32, 0.48). Furthermore, bedtime procrastination was moderately negatively associated with sleep duration (z = −0.31; CI: −0.37, −0.24), sleep quality (z = −0.35; CI: −0.42, −0.27) and moderately positively associated with daytime fatigue (z = 0.32; CI: 0.25, 0.38). Further high-quality studies are needed to identify causal relationships between bedtime procrastination and correlates, as well as bedtime procrastination and sleep. Future work will guide the development of interventions targeting bedtime procrastination for improved sleep outcomes."
The differential effects of sleep deprivation on pain perception in individuals with or without chronic pain: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Many experimental sleep deprivation (SD) studies were conducted to clarify the causal relationship between sleep and pain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to update the evidence regarding the effects of different experimental SD paradigms on various pain outcomes. Five databases were searched from their inception to June 2022. Separate random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled effect sizes (ES) of different experimental SD paradigms on various pain outcomes. Thirty-one studies involving 699 healthy individuals and 47 individuals with chronic pain were included. For healthy individuals, limited evidence substantiated that total SD significantly reduced pain threshold and tolerance (ES 0.74–0.95), while moderate evidence supported that partial SD significantly increased spontaneous pain intensity (ES 0.30). Very limited to moderate evidence showed that sleep fragmentation significantly increased peripheral and central sensitization in healthy individuals (ES 0.42–0.79). Further, there was very limited evidence that total or partial SD significantly aggravated spontaneous pain intensity in people with chronic pain. Our results accentuated that different SD paradigms differentially increased subjective pain intensity and worsened peripheral/central pain sensitization in healthy individuals, whereas the corresponding findings in people with chronic pain remain uncertain. Further rigorous studies are warranted to quantify their relationships in clinical populations."
The role of ovarian hormones in the pathophysiology of perimenopausal sleep disturbances: ,"A systematic review Sleep disturbance is a common clinical concern throughout the menopausal transition. However, the pathophysiology and causes of these sleep disturbances remain poorly understood, making it challenging to provide appropriate therapy. Our goal was to i) review the literature about the influence of ovarian hormones on sleep in perimenopausal women, ii) summarize the potential underlying pathophysiology of menopausal sleep disturbances and iii) evaluate the implications of these findings for the therapeutic approach to sleep disturbances in the context of menopause. A systematic literature search using the databases Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library was conducted. Keywords relating to ovarian hormones, sleep disturbances and menopause were used. Ultimately, 86 studies were included. Study Quality Assessment Tools of the National Institutes of Health were used for quality assessment. Results from good-quality studies demonstrated that the postmenopausal decline in estrogen and progesterone contributes to sleep disturbances in women and that timely treatment with estrogen and/or progesterone therapy improved overall sleep quality. Direct and indirect effects of both hormones acting in the central nervous system and periphery, as well as via secondary effects (e.g. reduction in vasomotor symptoms), can contribute to improvements in sleep. To strengthen external validity, studies examining neurobiological pathways are needed."
Clinical considerations for the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia,"Idiopathic hypersomnia is a sleep disorder of neurologic origin characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, with sleep inertia, long, unrefreshing naps, and prolonged nighttime sleep being key symptoms in many patients. Idiopathic hypersomnia is described in the International Classification of.. Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition as a central disorder of hypersomnolence with distinct clinical features and diagnostic criteria; however, confirming the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia is often challenging. Diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia is based on objective sleep testing and the presence of associated clinical features but may be difficult for clinicians to recognize and correctly diagnose because of its low prevalence, clinical heterogeneity, and symptoms, which are similar to those of other sleep disorders. The testing required for diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia also presents logistical barriers, and reliability of objective sleep measures is suboptimal. The pathophysiology of idiopathic hypersomnia remains unknown. In this review, clinical considerations related to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of idiopathic hypersomnia will be discussed, including perspectives from the European Union and United States."
"Comparison of the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy for pain, and hybrid cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and pain in individuals with comorbid insomnia and chronic pain: A systematic review and network meta-analysis","Considering that insomnia and chronic pain are often comorbid, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), cognitive behavioral therapy for pain (CBT-P), and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and pain (CBT-IP) in individuals with comorbid..... insomnia and chronic pain. We used PubMed, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and Web of Science for our literature search. The outcomes included sleep, pain, disability, and depression at post-treatment and follow-up (3–12 months). Sixteen randomized controlled trials with 1094 participants were included. In the Bayesian network meta-analysis, CBT-I [standard mean difference (SMD) = −0.99, 95% credible interval (CrI) = −1.50 to −0.54] and CBT-IP (SMD = −0.70, 95% CrI = −1.60 to −0.08) were significantly more effective than the control for sleep at post-treatment. Additionally, CBT-I was significantly more effective than the control for pain, disability, and depression at post-treatment and sleep at follow-up. However, there were no significant differences in effectiveness between CBT-P and the control for any outcomes. Thus, CBT-I might be the most effective treatment option for individuals with comorbid insomnia and chronic pain. However, given the small sample sizes and high risk of bias of the included studies, these results must be interpreted with caution."
